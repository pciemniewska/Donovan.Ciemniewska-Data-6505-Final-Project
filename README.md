# Donovan.Ciemniewska-Data-6505-Final-Project



We chose to conduct our analysis for our DATA 6505 final on 2022 Machine Learning and Data Science job opportunity data. We chose this because both of us have come from a different educational background and we do not know much about the analytics job market or the skills we should have. Additionally, we both face the fear of feeling as if we do not know enough or are not 'good' enough to get into this field. Overall, we conducted this analysis for ourselves and our peers to better understand the job opportunities that become available for students leaving Fairfield University's MSBA.
